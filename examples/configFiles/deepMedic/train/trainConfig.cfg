#Note: Values will be internally normalized (to add up to 1.0).

#[Optional] This variable allows providing weighted-maps to indicate where to extract more segments for each category of samples. Higher weight means more samples from that area.

#Similarly to the files listing the Ground Truth, Channels, etc per subject, these files should list the paths to the weight-maps of each subject for the corresponding category.
#Note: Number of files required: Fore/Backgr:2, Uniform:1, Full-Image:N/A, Separate each class:NumOfOutputClasses (Incl Backgr).
#IMPORTANT: Sequence of weight-maps is important!
#>> If Fore/Background type of sampling, provide for the FOREground first!
#>> If Separately sampling each class, provide weightmap-files in the same sequence as the class-labels in your Ground Truth! Eg background-0 first, class-1 second, etc.
#Default : If this variable is not provided, samples are extracted based on the Ground-Truth labels and the ROI.
