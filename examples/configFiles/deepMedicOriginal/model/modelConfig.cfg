#  +++++++++++Normal pathway+++++++++++

#  Each entry is an integer that specifies the number of Feature Maps to use in each of the layers.
numberFMsPerLayerNormal = [30, 30, 40, 40, 40, 40, 50, 50]
#  [Required] This list should have as many entries as the number of layers in the normal pathway.

#  [Optional] List with number of layers, at the output of which to make a residual connection with the input of the previous layer. Ala Kaiming He et al, "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".
#  Note: Numbering starts from 1 for the first layer, which is not an acceptable value (no previous layer).
#  Example: [4,6,8] will connect (add) to the output of Layer 4 the input of Layer 3. Also, input to 5th will be added to output of 6th, and input of 7th to output of 8th.
#  Default: [], no residual connections
layersWithResidualConnNormal = []

#  [Optional] Layers to make of lower rank. Ala Yani Ioannou et al, "Training CNNs with Low-Rank Filters For Efficient Image Classification".

#  Default: []

#  +++++++++++Subsampled pathway+++++++++++
#  [Optional] Specify whether to use a subsampled pathway. If False, all subsampled-related parameters will be read but disregarded in the model-construction.
#  Default: False
useSubsampledPathway = True

#  [Optionals] The below parameters specify the subsampled-pathway architecture in a similar way as the normal.
#  If they are ommitted and useSubsampledPathway is set to True, the subsampled pathway will be made similar to the normal pathway (suggested for easy use).
#  [WARN] Subsampled pathway MUST have the same size of receptive field as the normal. Limitation in the code. User could easily specify different number of FMs. But care must be given if number of layers is changed. In this case, kernel sizes should also be adjusted to achieve same size of Rec.Field.

#  [Optional] How much to downsample the image that the subsampled-pathway processes.
#  Requires either a) list of 3 integers, or b) list of lists of 3 integers.
#  Input example a) [3,3,3]   Creates one additional parallel pathway, where input is subsampled by 3 in the x,y,z axis (the 3 elements of the list).
#  Input example b) [[3,3,3], [5,5,5]]   Creates two additional parallel pathways. One with input subsampled by [3,3,3], and one subsampled by [5,5,5]. If not specified, each path mirrors the previous.

#  [Optional] After the last layers of the normal and subsampled pathways are concatenated, additional Fully Connected hidden layers can be added before the final classification layer.

#  Default: []
numberFMsPerLayerFC = [150, 150]

#  [Optional] Specify dimensions of the kernel in the first FC layer. This kernel combines the features from multiple scales. Applies to the final Classification layer if no hidden FC layers in network.
#  Note: convolution with this kernel retains the size of the FMs (input is padded).
#  Default: [1,1,1]

#  Default: equal to the training segment.
segmentsDimInference = [45,45,45]

#  +++++++++++Batch Sizes+++++++++++
#  [Required] The number of segments to create a batch.
#  The samples in a training-batch are all processed and one optimization step is performed.
#  Larger batches approximate the total data better and should positively impact optimization but are computationally more expensive (time and memory).
batchSizeTrain = 10
#  [Optionals] Batch sizes for validation and inference only influence the speed. The bigger the better. Depends on the segment size and the model size how big batches can be fit in memory.

#  [Optionals] Dropout Rates on the input connections of the various layers. Each list should have as many entries as the number of layers in the corresponding pathway.

#  Default: []
dropoutRatesNormal = []

#  [Optional] Initialization method for the conv kernel weights.

#  Specify over how many batches (SGD iterations) this moving average should be computed. Value <= 0 disables BN.
#  Default : 60
rollAverageForBNOverThatManyBatches = 60
